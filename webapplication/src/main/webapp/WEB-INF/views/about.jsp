					<p>The bees in our garden collect nectar from the wild flowers
						blossomed everywhere in the nearby "Saihadri" jungles. This honey
						is ideal with "Dosa" each morning. It also has immense medicinal
						values in addition to it's distinct, natural taste. Over the
						years, we have been selling it to our "near and dear ones" for a nominal price.</p>
					<p>We grow mouth-watering mangoes in our backyard. The mango
						season is typically between April and June every year. The
						saplings of these mangoes were bought from different parts of
						our country and carefully tendered and nurtured by us for several
						years.</p>
					<p>We will ship home-grown Mangoes and Mango Grafts (both
						seasonal), as well as Organic honey to your door, if you are in
						the state of Karnataka, India.</p>
					<p>Our family name is "Bhagwat". Our hometown is in a quaint
						little village "Karki", in the West Coast of Karnataka, India. It
						is located about half-way between Panjim and Mangalore. National
						Highway 66 and the Konkan railway both pass through it.</p>
					<p>The head of our family is affectionaltely called "Bee
						Master" by the local folks. He was a teacher and a "bee keeping"
						hobbyist for decades. He taught this hobby to many people in the
						region. Now, his younger son assits him.</p>
