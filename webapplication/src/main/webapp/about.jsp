						<p>Our family name is "Bhagwat". Our home is in Karki, close
							to the West Coast of Karantaka, India. Do visit us if you are
							driving by - we are located half-way between Panjim and
							Mangalore, adjacent to the National Highway.</p>
						<p>The head of our family is affectionaltely called "Bhagwat
							Mastar" by the local folks. He was a teacher and a "bee keeping"
							hobbyist for decades. Now his younger son has taken over the
							hobby. The bees in our garden collect nectar from the wild
							flowers blossomed everywhere in the nearby Saihadri jungles. This
							honey has medicinal values in addition to it's distinct, natural
							taste. Over the years, we have given samples of it to various
							temples in the vicinity. We also sell it to our "near and dear
							ones" for a nominal price.</p>
						<p>We grow mouth-watering mangoes in our own backyard. The
							mango season is typicall between April and June every year. The
							saplings of these mango trees were bought from different parts of
							our country and carefully tendered and nurtured by us for several
							years.</p>
						<p>We will ship home-grown Mangoes and Mango Grafts (both are
							seasonal), as well as Organic honey to your door, if you are in
							the state of Karnataka, India.</p>
