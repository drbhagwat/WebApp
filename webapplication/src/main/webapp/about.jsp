					<p>Our family name is "Bhagwat". Our hometown is in a sweet
						little village Karki, in the West Coast of Karantaka, India. Karki
						is located about half-way between Panjim and Mangalore. National
						Highway 66 and the Konkan railway both pass through Karki.</p>
					<p>The head of our family is affectionaltely called "Bee
						Master" by the local folks. He was a teacher and a "bee keeping"
						hobbyist for decades. He taught this hobby to many people in the
						region. Now, his younger son has taken over the hobby.</p>
					<p>The bees in our garden collect nectar from the wild flowers
						blossomed everywhere in the nearby Saihadri jungles. This honey is
						ideal with Dosa each day mroning. It also has immense medicinal
						values in addition to it's distinct, natural taste. Over the
						years, we have given samples of it to various temples in the
						vicinity. We also sell it to our "near and dear ones" for a
						nominal price.</p>
					<p>We also grow mouth-watering mangoes in our backyard. The
						mango season is typically between April and June every year.
						Usually, the crop is good every alternate year. The saplings of
						these mango trees were bought from different parts of our country
						and carefully tendered and nurtured by us for several years.</p>
					<p>We will ship home-grown Mangoes and Mango Grafts (both are
						seasonal), as well as Organic honey to your door, if you are in
						the state of Karnataka, India.</p>
